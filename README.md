# Student Registration API (Summer of Making)

This project is part of Hack Club's **Summer of Making**.  
It is **not a new build** â€” I started it earlier in the year and am continuing development as part of this program.

The API is built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **PostgreSQL** to manage:
- Students
- Courses
- Registrations (course enrollments)

## ðŸ“œ Background
I began building this project before Summer of Making as a learning exercise in backend development.  
So far, Iâ€™ve implemented:
- Basic CRUD endpoints for Students & Courses
- PostgreSQL database schema
- Registration logic linking students to courses

## ðŸŽ¯ Summer of Making Goals
During the program, I will:
- Deploy the API publicly (Render/Railway)
- Add authentication (JWT)
- Add advanced queries (search, filtering, pagination)
- Create an admin dashboard frontend
- Improve documentation and error handling

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Node.js (ES Modules)
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- node-postgres (`pg`)

## ðŸš€ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/https://github.com/B-o-r-g-e/Student-Registration-System.git
